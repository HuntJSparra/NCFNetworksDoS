# NCFNetworksDoS
Term Project for New College of Florida's Networks class

# Idea
We created this project with a joke in mind, "What if we created a website which taught you to do Denial of Service attacks and the whole point is that you attack the website that taught you?"

# Technologies
We built this project with Flask in Python and some simple HTML.

# How to run
I was unable to run the server on Windows however I was able to get it to run within a Linux VM. So lets talk about how to do that
1) Install python3 `apt install python3'
1) Install flask `apt install python3-flask`
1) Run the server with `bash start.sh`
