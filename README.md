# NCFNetworksDoS
Term Project for New College of Florida's Networks class

# Idea
We created this project with a joke in mind, "What if we created a website which taught you to do Denial of Service attacks and the whole point is that you attack the website that taught you?"

# Technologies
We built this project with Flask in Python and some simple HTML.

# How to run
1) You'll need Python and Flask to run this project. 
1) You can download Python from https://www.python.org/. You'll need Python 3.4 or newer
1) You also need to install Flask since that's what our server runs on. You can find how to install it at https://pypi.org/project/Flask/
1) Run start.sh and it should work
